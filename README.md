# Editor Autofocus, plugin for Obsidian

A simple plugin to autofocus the editor window when opening new files. I use this in combination with [Filename heading sync](https://github.com/dvcrn/obsidian-filename-heading-sync) to skip naming the note (in the tab title bar). I simply focus on the editor. Hope it's useful to someone.
