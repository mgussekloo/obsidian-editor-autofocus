# Editor Autofocus, plugin for Obsidian

A simple plugin to skip the tab title bar + select the first heading for new notes. Works great in combination with [Filename heading sync](https://github.com/dvcrn/obsidian-filename-heading-sync) to make creating new notes easy and efficient.

When opening notes with 2 lines or less, this plugin will focus the editor window and select the first line for you.
